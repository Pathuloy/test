            <h3>My Story Eight years ago</h3>
            <img src="../dist/img/bedpic.jpg" alt="depression in bed" />
            <p>
              I was in the darkest phase of my life. I was severely depressed
              and the act of leaving my bed was daunting. Being a freshman in
              high school, I attended a private college preparatory school (most
              of the time) and stayed home on days I needed to. I performed
              school tasks when I could (that is when there was a break from the
              confusion that overwhelms the depressed brain).
            </p>
            <p>
              I attended private tutoring and was helped by both of my parents
              on school assignments. Support that was above and beyond what most
              parents are capable or willing to provide. It is without a doubt
              that my success in school that year is attributed to my parents’
              determination and creativity.
            </p>

            <p>
              I participated in softball (despite the bullying from my
              teammates. I kept putting one foot in front of the other but I
              didn’t know why. Other than the overwhelming pain that harming
              myself would bring my parents, I had no other reason to care for
              myself.
            </p>

          </div>
          By care for myself I mean survive. I certainly was not engaging in the
          self care practices I live by today. In fact, the act of discussing my
          depression with my parents was cringe worthy. I thought that my
          depression was my burden and not my parents. After all they have given
          me and continue to provide me, why burden them with something as heavy
          as their child’s declining mental health? Who needs that tacked on to
          a long week at work? I learned the power of energy when being
          attracted to friends that were also severely depressed as if the dark
          cloud above me needed some storms. Being trapped in a whirlwind of
          hopelessness, my friends and I did our best to support each other when
          we ourselves could barely stand up. Doing my best to prevent
          catastrophic decisions by my friends such as suicide, I reached out
          the school counselor, began seeing a therapist outside of school, and
          recommended my therapist to a friend. A turning point of my path
          towards recovery occurred after my mom was discussing the upcoming
          school year as the summer came to a close. At some point in the
          conversation I burst into tears and begged to not go back to that
          school. My mom, embracing me in her arms, supported my decision and
          began brainstorming other options for my education. We decided I would
          attend a public performing arts high school in a different school
          district in hopes that dancing coupled with less scholastic demands
          would improve my mood. I began my first day of sophomore year in the
          emergency room as I recovered from repeated panic attacks and
          regurgitation of bile. Released just two hours before orientation, I
          took my ID photo with bloodshot eyes and a lot of teal eyeliner on.
          Things started getting better. There was a new environment and tasks I
          had to complete that kept me focused. I signed up for water polo
          (after I was not allowed on the college prep team at my former high
          school). I decided to do water polo because I was told I couldn’t.
          This started my drive for proving people wrong who had doubted me.
          I’ve learned now that you must prove your own doubts wrong as well and
          that just because you can do something doesn’t me you need to do it.
          You must choose which doubts are worth proving wrong and which people
          are worth putting their place. I look back and do not regret choosing
          to play water polo. It was the hardest I’ve ever worked physically and
          I just what I needed to slap myself into the present moment (even if
          for just a 24 minute game). Being competitive, I was hard on myself
          when I didn’t get to play because I wasn’t fast enough. I refused to
          use the excuse that I was half the physical size as my opponents. I
          refused to use my exercised-induced asthma as an excuse and I sure as
          heck refused to use my depression as an excuse. I worked hard every
          practice. I was the last one to leave the pool because I was cleaning
          up and making sure nobody left anything. I was often partnered with
          the second to slowest and smallest player. Her and I got along well. I
          wanted so hard to be her close friend. I wanted it too hard. I
          tirelessly to be everyone’s best friend by listening to them complain
          about school and life. I remained a shoulder to complain on and not a
          friend to depend on. I tried to prove that I was fun and dependable
          but I was not popular (far from it). I ate lunch in my coach’s
          classroom (she was also a science teacher). I cried in the bathrooms
          alone. I stayed to talk to my teachers because I wanted someone to
          talk to you. I decided that if I couldn’t have friends, I could at
          least have a high grade point average. I didn’t notice why I was able
          to focus on school tasks, I was just suddenly able to. I could manage
          group projects and coach my peers. I could take college level courses
          and engage in a two year research course. I would at least be
          acknowledged and recognized for my academic achievements. I realize
          now that I had a purpose greater than my darkest moments. I realize
          now the importance of stepping back and identifying what you are
          feeling. I also am able to do this now. The therapist back in my
          freshman year, tried to get me to identify my feelings and what I felt
          was emptiness. I thought the idea of identifying my mood is stupid and
          useless. It is okay if that’s how you feel. There is room to grow with
          that perspective. Now when I feel an unpleasant feeling, I identify
          the feeling, accept it, and keep moving forward. Eventually it goes
          away and it is not a waiting gain worth your time. Depression is like
          a bird that will come and sit on your shoulder. The duration of the
          visit varies, the visit comes often without notice, and is never
          welcomed, but the visit is happening. Accept that. Denial does nothing
          but temporarily repress depression that will bring back a whole family
          of depressed birds this time. Anyways, high school did not fly by for
          me (like others like to say it did for them). High school was like
          watching paint dry while buckets of wet paint were chucked at the
          wall. Eventually it was over. Thank freaking goodness. While I did
          grow in high school, well not that much. I am still 4’ 10” or 1.47m.
          But, seriously, I grew emotionally or rather I began to grow. As I
          worked as a cashier at a local car wash during the summer, I started
          experiencing panic attacks. I began seeing a psychiatrist who
          recommended I tackle my diet, exercise, and sleep before medicated
          treatment. For which, I responded in my head, how often do you feel
          like running, cooking, and sleeping during a panic attack? I was put
          on anti-anxiety medication. My psychiatrist really sold me on the
          medication saying something along the lines of, “This will not
          eliminate the panic attacks. This will just make it a little bit
          easier to get through the day”. I thought, “Really? I want a pill that
          will make me feel better now. Tonight at the latest.” She was right.
          She set an accurate expectation. I was able to get through the day but
          wasnt as vibrant as I used to be. Anti-anxiety medication works to
          regulate your serotonin levels which affect your sleep, ambition, and
          sense of accomplishment. I was not feeling so low but I was also not
          ever feeling high on life. Even during my darkest days, there were
          moments of relief that were pure joy. For instance, one of my fondest
          memories is being relieved of the excruciating pain I was in following
          the bile regurgitation. I felt so good lying there as I was finally
          not vomiting, nauseous, and dehydration. I was convinced I must look
          as good as I feel so I asked my sleep deprived father to take a photo
          of pale, smiling face. I posed like I was riding a horse. Let’s just
          say, I’ve had better photos taken since. Along, posting this photo as
          my Linkedin photo would be a conversation starter to say the least.
          Eventually, I decided to start exercising with Youtube videos, eating
          healthier, and sleeping more hours. I started feeling so much better,
          I called my physciatrist and ditched class to share my newfound
          health. I even apply for a job as a car sales associate and ended up
          meeting my now boyfriend of three years, Manuel. After discussing my
          experience with the anxiety medication with my new health conscious
          boyfriend, I decided to wean myself off the drug (per doctor’s
          guidance). My psychiatrist was more than supportive and explained that
          the medication was meant to help me get on my feet and not a lifelong
          prescription. Well I was on my feet (a lot as a car sales consultant)
          and running around with energy and appreciation for my mental clarity.
          It has been four years and I am entering my fifth and final year for
          my undergraduate degree in accounting. I didn’t think I could make it
          through the day eight years ago, now I am working on my honors thesis,
          training for a marathon, writing a children’s book, running a podcast,
          raising a puppy, living in an apartment with my boyfriend, teaching
          personal training, learning golf, cooking healthy meals (even for the
          puppy), and living with purpose. Even with all that, I still have days
          of sadness, unwarranted or warranted feelings that fog my mind. By
          talking with friends and family, about our journeys, I have decided to
          organize and teach how I have allowed my purpose, not my depression,
          to drive my life. I know my story is not your story. You have
          obstacles far different than mine and unfortunately, maybe not the
          support system I had. I am here. The entire living with purpose
          community is here. We are here to say that when there is a purpose,
          there is a way. Blog post: Purpose versus Passion I do believe purpose
          is different than passion. Purpose is constant while passion is
          variable. One can be passionate about a cause without that being your
          purpose. Our passion changes far more often than our purpose. For
          instance, my purpose is to teach self love and compassion. It is
          through self compassion that we can become compassionate to others.
          How we can expect ourselves to share an emotion towards another being
          that we are incapable of sharing with ourselves. To feel that you are
          not loved is to be lonely. We are social beings and knowing that our
          presence is not only accepted but embraced, is crucial for our mental
          health. From a young child, I have worried about others well-being and
          felt proud when I bring a smile to someone’s face. In contrast, my
          passion has changed numerous times. Passions that I was at one point
          certain I would pursue as a career include: dancing, horse training,
          teaching math, tutoring English, traditional/western medicine (Medical
          Doctor), and full time fitness instructor. Now, I am less than one
          year away from graduating with my Bachelors in Accountancy.
          Accountancy is not a passion of mine rather I believed getting the
          degree would allow me to learn about running my own business and alot
          me the time to learn and grow while getting my degree. While getting
          my degree, I have continued to follow my purpose to teach self love
          and compassion. Appreciating and valuing my professors, peers, and
          myself has allowed me to view my education with purpose not as a
          chore. Value the stage of your life you are in. Value the role you
          have. Are you a mother, employee, spouse, entrepreneur, college
          student, or perhaps a combination? You are surviving, but are you
          thriving? Let’s start thriving together. Blog Post: Discomfort and
          Comfort You learn about yourself by seeking new experiences. My dear
          friend Kristina once told me to, “Lean in to the discomfort.” When we
          lean in to the discomfort we are forced to search for purpose in the
          pain. Purpose does not come from repetition unless the action you are
          repeating already brings you purpose. Embark on journeys that scare
          you. Be okay with the unknown. Plans are good, but adaptation is
          necessary. Life is full of surprises. Live. Adapt. Reflect. Grow. Your
          purpose will follow.
